Mining Web Data for Business Insights

# Problem Scenario
Our group identified that it is challenging for students to determine if their resumes are suitable for the jobs that they are intending to apply for. 
This could result in immediate rejection from the companies if the resume does not fit the intended requirements.

# The Solution
As such, our group decided to develop various models to help accurately identify if a resume is particularly suited for a certain job category.

We performed web scrapping to obtain resumes from indeed.com and proceeded to process the text with NLTK.
We then utilised various machine learning algorithms including:
1. Support Vector Machines
2. Random Forest Classifiers
3. LSTM
4. Ensemble methods

To accurately predict the job category of a resume.
