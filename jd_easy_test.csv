<b> </b>who is adept at driving key account revenue and growing our consultative sales. The Enterprise Sales Director will be responsible for owning the target accounts pipeline and driving our client acquisition programs, analyzing client acquisition metrics, and working with adjacent teams to develop strategies and campaigns to enhance client acquisition.

Our clients trust us because of our expertise and willingness to disrupt all elements of the talent and resourcing . You will be seen as a thought partner, tasked with building out best-in-class talent and digital strategies.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><b><br/> Manage and oversee a sales team</b>:<b> </b>this group of individuals is the heart of our business and while you will be tasked with growing the team in the next year, we predominantly want to remain lean. Your role in the team is to ensure all strategy work is exceptional and continues to push the status quo in our industry. As part of this role, you will be tasked with building out and continually improving processes that help us be more effective. You will work to nurture and grow that talent within your department, focusing on improving individual performance and engagement.</li>

You use this past knowledge to inspire confidence in our future and current clients.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li><b><br/> Great at managing a team but want to be doing sales;</b> it’s likely at this point in your career you’ve managed very large teams.

<ul>
<li><b><br/> Someone who inspires confidence in clients and is great at building relationships;</b> you are able to build relationships with clients and other stakeholders very quickly and earn their trust.

<p>JET.AVE is a local marketing agency started by Jet and Ave in 2016 to help brands connect with their consumers. We believe communication is a two-way street, a conversation. Brands should either start or join a conversation instead of having a monologue (cues hard-selling) and risk appearing unapproachable. Our mission is to provide clients direction to navigate around that. And that is also why JET.AVE’s logo and website look is street-themed – we’re not an automotive company!</p>
<p>We are big enough to dare, but small enough to care. How we operate or manage clients have never been determined by the “industry norm”. We set out to be change-makers, operating in ways that we believe in and continuously refine them to serve our people and clients better. The agency personalises strategies for every client and consistently delivers highly original creatives.</p>
<p>Join us if you:<br/>- An extroverted individual who thrives on conversations and readily offers opinions<br/>- Frequent social media user who always knows what's trending and is not afraid to be on camera for a TikTok/IGS/IGR<br/>- A team player who is resourceful, takes initiative, and learns from feedback<br/>- A creative spirit with fresh ideas, a sound aesthetic, and a passion to experiment<br/>- A multitasker who handles pressure well and works fast without compromising on the details</p>

<br/> Reversing the impact of climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. And businesses have a responsibility to lead the way. While individual consumer choices are important, over 80% of all the emissions reductions necessary for the world to reach Net-Zero, require business-level action. But despite the growing momentum and ambition from companies around the world to set Net-Zero goals, there are significant challenges to delivering on these ambitions. Business leaders don’t really know how they will get there. And the very first step, of getting emissions measurement right, is hard.

<p><b>A BIT ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>We're at the forefront of one of the most exciting evolutions of our generation - remote employment. No longer do employers have to hire according to geography, and no longer do employees have to worry about proximity to work and daily commutes. Today, companies can hire the best talent they can find, anywhere in the world. But they need digital solutions to help them streamline the process.</p>
<p>We are Multiplier! Our global employment platform empowers companies to contract staff all across the world, while managing the complexities of local compliance, labour contracts, payroll, benefits and taxes - all from one software system. It's a game changer!</p>
<p>We're on a mission to impact economies of scale, and disrupt the traditional employer of record (EOR) space. We're backed by some of the best in the game (Sequoia and Golden Gate Ventures), led by domain level experts, scaling massively, and seeking brilliant like minded enthusiasts to join our team.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A BIT ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY</b></p>
<p>We're going to 20x our business in 2023, and are building a world class sales org to help us get there. Our Regional Sales Directors are responsible for helping us build world class sales teams, processes, and to deliver on exceptionally ambitious revenue targets. We expect to grow from less than 5 sales reps in the Americas, to more than 30 this year alone. Sales Managers will be responsible for hiring Business Development Reps (BDRs) to help drive outbound pipeline and Account Executives (AEs) to close those prospects.</p>
<p>As an SM, you'll be reporting to the Global Sales Director (we'll place a Sales Director in-market ASAP), and work closely with your peers and cross functional stakeholders. Process, efficiency, and tenacity will be critical to our/your success in this role.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What you'll do:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Consistently deliver on sales targets for your team of up to 8 reps.</li>
<li> Manage and train BDRs to drive consistent pipeline through outbound sales efforts.</li>
<li> Train AEs to deliver incredibly effective demos, and nurture prospects to closed-won.</li>
<li> Recruit, onboard, and develop exceptional sales talent across all business groups (BDRs and AEs).</li>
<li> Help build career plans for your staff, and maximise retention of top talent.</li>
<li> Help us build a predictable, repeatable, and scalable sales engine.</li>
<li> Provide access to a rolodex of high value prospects through your personal and professional network.</li>
<li> Ensure the team are using our tech stack (HubSpot, ZoomInfo, SalesLoft, and Linkedin Sales Navigator) as intended, while keeping meticulous track of all sales deals and pipeline.</li>
<li> Deliver on quarterly OKRs, with a laser focus on data.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>What you'll bring:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Min 8 years B2B sales experience (ideally in SaaS), with a track record of achieving quota.</li>
<li> Min 2 years of quota attainment as manager, out of the last 3 years.</li>
<li> An exceptional appreciation for the complexities of your craft.</li>
<li> An affinity to work (thrive!) as a remote employee.</li>
<li> The ability to work independently, problem solve proactively, and collaborate effectively.</li>
<li> Excellent leadership, communication and presentation skills.</li>
<li> A process oriented approach to sales.</li>
<li> Work ethic beyond the norm, and a commitment to excellence as a leader.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>What we'll provide for you:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to contribute to this business at a high level.</li>
<li> Autonomy within your role.</li>
<li> Ability to work fully-remotely.</li>
<li> Working with a compassionate, energetic, inspired, ambitious, global, and diverse team.</li>
<li> Opportunity to grow within a fast-growth business.</li>
<li> Competitive benefits, compensation, and culture of recognition.</li>
<li> Unlimited holiday policy.</li>
<li> A commitment to positively impact your career.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>A BIT ABOUT YOU</b></p>
<p>You're a company builder, not just a sales leader. You absolutely love working with a unique and inspired workforce, and being part of a dispersed team. Startups excite you because you covet the opportunity to contribute to building something special, early on. You understand the art and science of sales, and use systems and mathematics to succeed. You've been successful in management, and relish the opportunity to grow. You're progressively minded, creative, accountable, and quirky in your own way. If this sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY</b></p>
<p>Multiplier is an equal opportunity employer: we value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p>
